What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 I learned just how big of a difference good music can make in a game

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 It has good looking virus enemies that you have to avoid in order to win.

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 If my games had music like that, I think that they would feel a lot more lively and be more intersting to play.

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 Other than to find a way to make the enemies move, you could add more levels with harder enemies after the player reaches a certain score.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 Nothing really 'confused' me, but I had no idea how to get the enemies to move myself.

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 Yes

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 I'm not sure that there's anything that I'd add to make it better

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

 I absolutely loved the music. I kept playing just to listen to more haha

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
