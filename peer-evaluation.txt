Group's repository: https://github.com/haoylin/Project-final



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
Using dedicated timers for things such as spawning.
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
You are trying to avoid the virus, just like how quaratining is trying to avoid the spread
of COVID-19.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
The eye movement of the player character. It's an added indicator to the player's current direction
that gives the player immediate feedback that is helpful. Very intuitive.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Having enemies move around. Right now they only spawn in a set space, so even randomizing that would make it 
more difficult. But movement as well would help with this.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I don't know what "PI" means in the main.gd script.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes.
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Yes.
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
More about the resources, specifically assets they used. 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
I really liked the player character, it was very cute. I like the different way the legs moved 
(bigger movements going up and down, smaller movements side to side), and the way the eyes followed
the current direction.
