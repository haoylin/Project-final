Group's repository: hoaylin/Project-final



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?

 I learned there's a mob path node in Godot 2D.

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 You're trying to avoid touching viruses 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

 The mob path node seems like a useful tool

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?

 When I launched the game the viruses would't move from where they spawned, so that should probably be fixed if it wasn't already.  

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 The scripts make it seem like the viruses were suppose to move so I'm not sure why they didn't

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 Yes they wrote down their roles in the repository, though they never listed who was in charge of assets outside the music

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 They could have a video/gif of how it's suppose to play.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

I really liked the background music

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
