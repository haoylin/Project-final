Group's repository: 



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
I learned that the speed and moement of a character can make a difference in the enjoyment levels. 
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
This game definitely went into the direction of teh Corona Virus, after all, you have to try not and get affected by it. There is the virus,
and your whole goal is not to catch it, or get hit by it. 

 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
I think that the game had a good animation system for the player charqacter, and I would like to add better player animations to my games as that is 
not one of my strong suits and they did a great job with that.

 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
I think they should incorporate some kind of movement for the enemies, but I suspect that they just ran out of time to do that. I would also think that having 
some kind of way to have combat against the virus would also be nice for a user. There was also a bug where the game was restarttign that could be looked into.
All in all, I think they were on a good track.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
I didn't see anything that was confusing to me in the GDScript, but I enjoyed the way that they instanced in new scenes in the script, and I 
would like to get better with HUD scripts, and theirs seemed pretty useful.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes, It seems clear that every member of their group probably played some role in making this game.

 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
I could not find a Liscense
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
I think they could add a picture of the gameplay so players can see what they are currently making and the ways that they thought about the top[ic could be expanded upon.
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
I think they did an excellent job animating the player based on the direction that he was moving, and having good player animation is one way to give a tactile feel to a game and They did a good job with that.


How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
I would give them 2 out of my 5 points to allocate.
