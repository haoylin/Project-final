Group's repository: DreamStudio



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
I learned about how to make an IOS style game
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?

 You have to practice sopcial distance and avoid the virus

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?

I liked how the music fitted the theme of the game. That is always important to have.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
I feel like the AI randomly appears and does not follow a specifc path. It kind of just pops up and stays there I'm not sure if this is wahat was intended or if ti is a glitch.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?

 

Is it clear that every group member participated?

 Yes

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

 Yes

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

 Its really descriptive.

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.

It was fun to play and I could see it potentially on the app store. With the height of the corona virus you could slap a couple of adds on it and make some money. 

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?

I would give them 16 if the AI was not supposed to just pop up and stay still. If it was then 20
